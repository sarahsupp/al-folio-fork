### Introduction to Data Analytics (DA 101)
An introductory course with a lab component. Students can expect to learn an introduction to programming in R and R studio, gain an appreciation for the data analytics cycle, and apply foundational statistics to real datasets across disciplinary silos. The course also includes a discussion component addressing data issues of our day such as ethical dilemmas, social justice in big data, data art, career applications, and more. Lab projects may change between semesters but have included examples from ecology, health, political science, housing markets, basketball, and more.

### Data Analytics Colloquium (DA 200)
A once-per week interactive course with topics that change every semester. The focus of the course is to increase student engagement with each other and with invited speakers on current data analytics topics. Opportunities for practicing skills and for professional development will also be included in materials.

### Theory and Practice of Data Visualization (DA 245, Special Topics)
This course was co-taught with Josh Smith (a data visualization professional, Columbus, OH) using Tableau as the main visualization tool. Students read primary literature and texts on scientific theory and artistic design principles, and created a Tableau portfolio of advanced data visuals on topics of their choosing, using a workshop-style creative-writing informed format. 

### Practicum in Data Analytics (DA 301)
Students collaborate in teams as data analytics consultants for clients. They work on the same problem for an entire semester, culminating in a final presentation and discussion with their clients. 

### Data Analytics Seminar (DA 401)
For the Senior Capstone, students conduct independent research on a novel question, and write a 20+ page academic-style paper summarizing their results. 

### Other teaching pursuits
I am a volunteer for _The Carpentries_ and occasionally teach 2-day workshops at other institutions. I am also a co-PI for the BEDE Network, which is developing short-format data science training workshops for undergraduate Biology Instructors.
